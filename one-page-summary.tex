\title{MSRI Spring 2020 semester on \textbf{Quantum Symmetries}: summary}

\begin{document}
\maketitle



Symmetry, as formalized by group theory, is ubiquitous across mathematics and science. Classical examples include point groups in crystallography, Noether's theorem relating differentiable symmetries and conserved quantities, and the classification of fundamental particles according to irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group and the internal symmetry groups of the standard model. However, in some quantum settings, the notion of a group is no longer enough to capture all symmetries.  Important motivating examples include Galois-like symmetries of von Neumann algebras, anyonic particles in condensed matter physics, and deformations of universal enveloping algebras. The language of tensor categories provides a unified framework to discuss these notions of quantum symmetry.

Within the framework of studying the various guises of quantum symmetries, and their interactions, we will focus on following seven areas.
\begin{enumerate}

  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item Tensor categories, fusion categories, module categories, and applications to representation theory.
\item Braided, symmetric, and modular tensor categories.
\item Hopf algebras, their actions on rings, and classification of semisimple and of pointed Hopf algebras.
\item Subfactors, planar algebras, and analytic properties of quantum symmetries.
\item Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, and local topological field theories.
\item Conformal nets, vertex algebras, and their representation theories.
\item Topological order and topological quantum computation.
\end{enumerate}

Potential graphics to use alongside the one-page summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item An associahedron: $$\mathfig{0.4}{A4-vertices}$$
\item An equation from the skein theory of quantum $G_2$: $$\mathfig{0.75}{G2}$$
\item A diagram showing modularisation of a quantum group at a root of unity:
$$\mathfig{0.3}{sl4-modularisation-domain} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \mathfig{0.3}{sl4-300}$$
\end{itemize}
We'd love to find an appropriate graphic illustrating string diagrams for a tensor category (possibly suggesting a Levin-Wen string net model), but haven't found anything.
