\section{Quantum Symmetry}

\nn{
The description should include a background of the topic, relationships with
other parts of mathematics or other disciplines, goals and areas of potential
progress, an outline of the proposed program's structure, proposed involvement
of postdocs and interactions with other scientists, and why the proposal is
particularly suited to MSRI. It is highly desirable that the program show the
breadth of the mathematical field being treated, and take into special account
its relation to other fields of mathematics and (in appropriate cases) other
sciences and engineering.
}

We are proposing a one-semester MSRI program with the goal of advancing and
unifying the study of quantum symmetry throughout mathematics, with an
emphasis on the appearance of tensor categories in the study of operator
algebras, representation theory, mathematical physics, and topology.

\subsection{What is Quantum Symmetry?}

Symmetry, as formalized by group theory, is ubiquitous across mathematics and
science.  However, in some quantum settings, the notion of a group is no
longer enough to capture all symmetries.  Important motivating examples
include Galois-like symmetries of von Neumann algebras, anyonic particles in
condensed matter physics, and deformations of universal enveloping algebras.
It is not clear how to directly generalize the notion of a group to encompass
these examples.

To achieve this, we first take a different viewpoint on classical symmetries,
replacing the group with an appropriate category of representations.  Such a
category of representations has a rich structure: most crucially one can form
tensor products of representations.  Thus to any group we can naturally assign
a tensor category, which captures many of the features of the group. This
replacement has a long history in both mathematics (pioneered by Weyl) and
physics (where the basic excitations of a system are typically indexed by the
irreducible representations of the symmetry group).

When we produce a tensor category as the representation theory of a group, the
tensor product will always be commutative. We can consider the more general
case, and thus begin the formalisation of all examples of quantum symmetries
as various classes of tensor categories. This is a natural analogue of
generalizing the notion of space in algebraic geometry, by replacing rings of
functions on a variety with noncommutative rings, or of thinking of
$C^*$-algebras as noncommutative topological spaces.

Quantum symmetry has appeared independently many times in mathematics in
different guises, including tensor categories, topological phases of matter,
subfactors, Hopf algebras, and quantum groups. This program thus represents a
subject with broad connections across mathematics. Already, collaborations
between experts coming from different origins have revealed deep connections
between these subjects, but it seems clear that there is much more to come.
This MSRI program will significantly expand the research connections between
these fields, and lay the groundwork for a unified theory of quantum symmetry.

We want to particularly emphasise the rapid development of the study of
quantum symmetries in condensed matter physics over the last decade.
Physicists studying topological order have adopted the language of tensor
categories, and their work suggests many new fundamental problems in the
field. We intend that this semester program will include a substantial
presence of physicists interested in topological order, and facilitate
interactions between the mathematics and physics communities.

\subsubsection{Fusion categories}
The category of finite dimensional complex representations of a finite group
is semisimple and has only finitely many simple objects.  Fusion categories
are tensor categories which share these properties and thus are quantum
analogues of finite groups.

\subsubsection{Subfactors and planar algebras}
\todo{Scott}

To study a Galois field extension $K \subset M$, we begin by looking at the
Galois group of automorphisms of $M$ fixing $K$. For example, the intermediate
fields $K \subset L \subset M$ are parameterized by the subgroups of the
Galois group. This theory finds a noncommutative, or quantum, analogue in the
study of operator algebras, as the \emph{standard invariants of subfactors}.

The subject began with the striking observation by Jones that the index of a
subfactor was \emph{quantized}, and the possible values of the index are
exactly $\{4 \cos^2(\pi/n)\}_{n \geq 3} \cup [4,\infty]$. We now understand
that these restrictions are the consequence of a rich and rigid algebraic
structure underlying any subfactor subfactor.

Subfactors provide an alternative axiomatization of the notion of quantum
symmetry, especially adapted to the unitary setting. A subfactor is an
inclusion of von Neumann algebras with trivial centres. From a subfactor, one
can extract a finite algebraic gadget called the \emph{standard invariant}.
There have been many alternative ways to axiomatize and study these objects
(for example as Ocneanu's paragroups, Popa's $\lambda$-lattices, and Jones'
planar algebras). For our purposes here, a particularly interesting
alternative is as a pair $(\cC, A)$, where $\cC$ is a unitary pivotal fusion
category, and $A$ is an algebra object in $\cC$. The importance of subfactors
in the subject of quantum symmetries is seen in the fact that every such pair
in fact comes from some subfactor!

The techniques developed in the course of analyzing the standard invariants of
subfactors have resulted in unusual constructions of examples as well as
powerful obstructions to the existence of certain families. Indeed, the most
exotic known fusion categories at present --- the categories of $A-A$ or $B-B$
bimodules, for $A \subset B$ the extended Haagerup subfactor --- apparently
unobtainable starting from finite groups or quantum groups, have been
constructed as part of the program of classifying small index subfactors.

The various alternative axiomatizations of a standard invariant emphasize
different aspects of the algebraic structure, and typically suggest rather
different approaches. As an example, the `jellyfish algorithm', essential in
the construction of the extended Haagerup subfactor, is very natural from the
perspective of $\lambda$-lattices (although this relationship was only
understood later!). Further, the planar algebra approach emphasizes the
importance of the representation theory of the annular Temperley-Lieb-Jones
category, and this has led to very powerful constraints on quantum symmetries
which would not be obvious from a more algebraic approach. It seems clear that
these alternative perspectives have not been exhausted, and indeed will have
impact throughout the study of quantum symmetries.

\subsubsection{Conformal field theory}
\todo{Scott}

The connection between conformal field theory, and quantum symmetry as
introduced here, is far from well understood. Nevertheless, an essential
connection does exist, and there are many tantalizing hints of its importance.

Certainly, the representation category of a rational conformal field theory
gives a modular tensor category. It is possible, and indeed strongly suspected
by some, that in fact every modular tensor category is realized in this way.
Thus, as is the case with subfactors, conformal field theory can be thought of
as a host (perhaps universal) for certain types of quantum symmetries. Many
early examples of quantum symmetries (for example, the 2221 fusion category)
were first constructed via conformal field theory, although in many cases
subsequently a purely algebraic approach has been developed --- often enough
transporting some construction earlier known in CFT to the categorical
setting. It is very likely that CFT constructions will inspire further
development of structure theory for fusion categories and modular tensor
categories.

There are alternative axiomatizations of conformal field theories, e.g. via as
vertex operator algebras or as conformal nets (although the precise
relationship between them is still being worked out). The conformal net
approach is intimately related with the theory of subfactors. \nn{... and?

\subsubsection{Topological order}
\todo{Scott}

The discovery of topological order in condensed matter physics is a
fundamental theoretical breakthrough --- and hopefully in the future, with
some engineering breakthroughs, the foundation of new technologies including
topological quantum computation. Quantum symmetries promise to provide the
mathematical foundations for this physics and engineering.

Topological order goes beyond the standard theory of symmetry breaking, going
back to Landau, and can be understood in terms of systems whose `symmetries'
are not classical symmetries described by groups, but rather quantum
symmetries as discussed here. In particular, the fascinating realization is
that there are certain physical systems with effective descriptions via local
topological field theories. For physicists, topological order can be
characterized by the presence of robust ground state degeneracies, and these
degeneracies are exactly the vector space assigned by the governing
$d+1$-dimensional topological field theory to the $d$-manifold describing the
shape of the system. The higher categorical data determining the local
topological field theory should be thought of as the quantum symmetry of the
topological phase. In particular, for $2+1$-dimensional topological field
theory, this data is precisely a fusion category.
